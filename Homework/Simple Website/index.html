        <h2> The Wrecks </h2>
    </a>
    <p>
        <em> The Wrecks </em> have always been one of my favorite bands since discovering them in my junior year of high
        school. In
        particular, I love their songs: <em> Favorite Liar, Revolution, and Feels So Nice </em> the most. I've actually
        gotten
        tickets to see
        them coming
        this November so I am really excited to meet one of my all-time favorite bands!

        <h2> Paramore </h2>
    </a>
    <p>
        Growing up, <em> Paramore </em> has always been the band that was stuck in my head. I love how all their songs
        are such high energy, emotional, as well as just plain fun to listen to. Some of my favorites are: <em>
            Still Into
            You, Ain't it Fun, and Brick by Boring Brick.
        </em>

        <h2> The Band CAMINO </h2>
    </a>
    <p>
        I didn't realize how much I listened to <em> The Band CAMINO </em> until Spotify released their stats of each
        account publicly. Turns out, they are my #1 band of all-time on Spotify and for good reason too. I love their
        Indie/Alt-Rock vibe and all they songs can range from emotional solos to songs you'd play at a party. I love
        these songs by them: <em>See Through, Roses, and I Think I Like You</em>.
