        <p> This is a picture of my girlfriend and I's dog, Sansa! She's actually my girlfriend's service dog and is
            always my favorite part of coming home after a busy day. Her birthday is actually coming up on the 22nd, and
            she'll be turning six! It's crazy to think I've been apart of half her life. </p>
